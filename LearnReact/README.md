## How to create and nest components
React apps are made out of **components**. A component is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. 
> React components are *JavaScript* functions that return markup:
'''JavaScript
function MyButton(){
    return (
        <button>I'm a button</button>
    );
}
'''
